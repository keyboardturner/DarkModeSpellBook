# DarkModeSpellBook

This addon alllows changing the colors of various background images and text, allowing you to not be blinded by the bright spellbook colors when opening the spellbook.

This includes options for:

    Spell Text
    Large Text (like the Specialization and Class)
    Sub-Text (such as what indicates a spell being passive)
    Separators (art pieces below each Large Text)
    Bookmark
    Page Number Text
    Backplate / Backplate Highlight (the faint texture behind each spell text)
    Background

In addition to these features, this addon also allows the ability to fade the spellbook frame (including the specialization and talents) when moving, similar to the default behavior of the map.

An option to show/hide the "Spellbook Colors" button can be found in the AddOn Compartment Frame, located by the Calendar Button on the Minimap. It is purposefully not clickable in the settings menu in case it's accidentally clicked.
